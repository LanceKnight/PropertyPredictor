v1.0.0
a working version as a starting point:
features:
1. data are preprocessed
2. SimCLR model. However, the projection head is still a scalar

to-do:
1. change projection head to a vector and implement infoNCE
2. make dataset_cv.py accept different dataset names 
3. add loss-epoch plot
4. feature extension to more elements
